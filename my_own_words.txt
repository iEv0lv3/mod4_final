What assumptions will you make about this problem since you cannot ask clarifying questions?

I will assume that the given parameters are accurate:
* The payload will only contain unique integer numbers
* The payload will contain no other data types
* The payload will not contain duplicates

This challenge is looking for the most efficient way to search a list for (x + y = n).
Avoiding O(n^2) iteration is desired. My goal is to make a single iteration pass until
the desired number combination is found.

I'm going to use a dictionary and list to solve this challenge. The pro is that a single
iteration is required, the .get() search is fast, and the iteration will break as soon as
a desired result is found. The cons are that with a large data set I would potentially be
creating an additional large data set.

Find Complement of Target - Number. If Payload contains Complement, break iteration. Return
the value of Pairs.

I believe the BigO complexity of my solution is O(n). It's a single iteration, but it requires
creating a temporary data structure to help solve the problem.
